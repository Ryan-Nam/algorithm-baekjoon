As shown in the picture above, there is a honeycomb made of hexagons. As shown in the figure, starting from room 1 in the center, the address can be assigned a number that increases by 1 in turns to neighboring rooms. Given a number N, write a program that counts how many rooms (including the beginning and the end) it passes through the minimum number of rooms from the center of the honeycomb to rooms 1 through N. For example, up to 13 goes through 3, and up to 58 goes through 5.

input
The first line gives N(1 ≤ N ≤ 1,000,000,000).

Print
